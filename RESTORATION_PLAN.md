# 🔧 App Diagnostics and Restoration Plan

## 🔍 Current Issues Identified:
1. **Delete Game Button Not Working** - Primary issue
2. **Calendar Integration Complexity** - May be causing conflicts  
3. **Multiple Code Iterations** - Potential for function conflicts
4. **Event Handler Conflicts** - Possible duplicate or overridden handlers

## 📋 Two-Path Approach:

### Option A: Quick Restore from Original Files ⚡
**Pros:** Fast, clean start, known working state
**Cons:** Lose recent improvements, need to re-apply Firebase changes

**Steps:**
1. Restore clean app.js from archive
2. Restore clean index.html structure
3. Keep current Firebase configuration
4. Re-apply only essential fixes

### Option B: Systematic Debug and Fix 🔧
**Pros:** Keep all improvements, learn what's broken
**Cons:** More time-consuming, complex

**Steps:**
1. Isolate delete button functionality
2. Check event handler conflicts  
3. Verify editingGameId variable scope
4. Test step-by-step functionality

## 🧪 Immediate Diagnostics:

### Test Results Needed:
1. **Run diagnostics.html** - Check what objects/functions are missing
2. **Run delete-button-test.html** - Test isolated delete functionality
3. **Check browser console** - Look for JavaScript errors

### Quick Fixes to Try:
1. **Check editingGameId scope** - Variable may not be properly set
2. **Verify delete button exists** - DOM element may be missing
3. **Check event handler attachment** - Handler may not be properly bound

## 🚀 Recommended Approach:

**STEP 1**: Run both diagnostic tests first
**STEP 2**: Based on results, choose restoration vs. targeted fixes
**STEP 3**: If restoration needed, use clean archive files as base
**STEP 4**: Re-apply only essential Firebase/authentication changes

## 📂 Archive Files Available:
- `/Archive - Old Referee Apps/Referee App Clean Deploy/` - Latest working version
- `/Archive - Old Referee Apps/Referee App/` - Original version
- `/Archive - Old Referee Apps/Referee App Backup/` - Backup version

## 🔧 Quick Test Commands:
```bash
# Compare current vs archive app.js
diff "js/app.js" "/Users/shelbysavage/Desktop/Archive - Old Referee Apps/Referee App Clean Deploy/js/app.js"

# Restore clean app.js if needed
cp "/Users/shelbysavage/Desktop/Archive - Old Referee Apps/Referee App Clean Deploy/js/app.js" "js/app.js"

# Check what changed
git diff js/app.js
```

## 🎯 Next Steps:
1. **Tell me what the diagnostic tests show**
2. **Choose restoration vs. debugging path**
3. **Apply targeted fixes**
4. **Test and verify functionality**
5. **Deploy working version**

The key is to get back to a known working state quickly, then add features incrementally with testing at each step.
